### Introduction
Mean-field approximation is technique that can be used to study the approximate dynamics of a Markov population process, given that the size of the population is large enough. Generally, this is carried out by reducing/representing the system as a system of differential equations.

**Overall mean-field model**: An overall mean-field model, X, describes the limit behaviour of N->&infin; individual objects, each modelled by *X*, and is defined as a tuple (X,Q), that consists of an infinite set of states:
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
